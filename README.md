# Task Management Console App

This is a simple Task Management Console App implemented in Python. It allows users to manage their tasks by performing actions like adding tasks, updating task statuses, and listing tasks. Here's a brief overview of how the app works:

## Features

1. **Add Task**: Users can add a new task to the task list by providing a title, due date, and priority level.

2. **Update Task Status**: Users can update the status of a task by specifying its title and providing a new status. The available status options are "In Progress," "QA," "Postponed," and "Done."

3. **List Tasks**: Users can view a list of all the tasks in the task manager. The list includes task titles, due dates, priorities, and current statuses.

4. **Quit**: Users can exit the app when they are done managing their tasks.

## How to Use

1. Run the script, and you'll be presented with a menu of options.

2. Choose the desired action by entering the corresponding number.

3. Follow the prompts to input task details or update task statuses.

4. The app provides feedback for successful actions and guides you through the process.

5. You can list tasks at any time to see the current task list.

6. When you're finished, choose the "Quit" option to exit the app.

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how you might use the app:

1. Add a new task with the title "Complete Report," due date "2023-08-30," and priority "High."

2. Update the status of the task "Complete Report" to "In Progress."

3. List all tasks to see the updated status.

4. When you're done, choose "Quit" to exit the app.

## Dependencies

This app uses the `time` module for adding a pause between menu options for a better user experience.

## Feedback and Improvements

This Task Management Console App is a basic implementation that can serve as a starting point for more complex task management systems. You can extend it by adding features like task deletion, task descriptions, or even user authentication for multiple users.
